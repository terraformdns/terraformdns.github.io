The Terraform DNS project is a set of Terraform modules that aim to present
a common interface to creating DNS records across a number of different DNS
hosting providers.

[The project's modules](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraformdns)
each wrap a different DNS hosting provider, allowing DNS records to be
created in [a consistent way](./about/).

# Experimental

This project is currently experimental, and depends on Terraform features that
are not yet available in a stable release.
