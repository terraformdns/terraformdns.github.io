      <description>The Terraform DNS project aims to abstract over the various different DNS hosting products supported by Terraform so that DNS can be used as a standard building-block within your infrastructure, decoupled from other concerns.
DNS records always have the same high-level structure, regardless of which service is hosting them. Some vendors offer additional features on top of the basic DNS functionality, but there is a common baseline that can be used across many different providers.</description>
